# 3. Be SPECIFIC: Vague traits lead to inconsistent behavior
# 4. Test MENTALLY: Imagine conversations - does this persona feel right?
# 5. Keep it SIMPLE: 4-6 core traits are better than 10 fuzzy ones
# 6. Think about CONTRAST: How is this different from other personas?
#
# Remember: The user can adjust any persona with commands like:
# - "be more supportive" (increases warmth)
# - "be less verbose" (decreases verbosity)  
# - "challenge me more" (increases challenge)
# These work automatically with any persona you create!
