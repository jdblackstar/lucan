# SETTING CUSTOM DEFAULTS:
# 
# Most personas should start with all modifiers at 0, but you might want
# to adjust defaults to match the persona's natural style:
#
# COACH PERSONA might start with:
# challenge: 1, warmth: 1, structure: 1
#
# THERAPIST PERSONA might start with:  
# warmth: 2, emotional_depth: 1, challenge: -1
#
# ANALYST PERSONA might start with:
# structure: 2, verbosity: 1, emotional_depth: -1
#
# CREATIVE PERSONA might start with:
# warmth: 1, structure: -1, verbosity: 1

# HOW USERS ADJUST THESE:
#
# Users can say things like:
# - "be more supportive" → increases warmth
# - "be less verbose" → decreases verbosity  
# - "challenge me more" → increases challenge
# - "be more organized" → increases structure
# - "go deeper emotionally" → increases emotional_depth
#
# These adjustments happen automatically and are saved between sessions.
# The persona will announce significant changes (±2 or more) naturally in conversation.
